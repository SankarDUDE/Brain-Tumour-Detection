Brain tumor detection is the process of identifying the presence and location of a tumor in the brain. Early detection of brain tumors is crucial for improving patient outcomes, as treatment is most effective when the tumor is small and has not spread.

## Problem statement 
To Develop the various custom CNN models for Brain Tumour Detection and to identify the good accurate and efficient model to detect the brain tumour.
## About the project
- Convolutional Layer:
	This layer is the first layer that is used to extract the various features from the input images. In this layer, the mathematical operation of convolution is performed between the input image and a filter of a particular size MxM. 
- Pooling Layer:
	In most cases, a Convolutional Layer is followed by a Pooling Layer. The primary aim of this layer is to decrease the size of the convolved feature map to reduce the computational costs. This is performed by decreasing the connections between layers and independently operates on each feature map.
- Fully Connected Layer:
	The Fully Connected (FC) layer consists of the weights and biases along with the neurons and is used to connect the neurons between two different layers. These layers are usually placed before the output layer and form the last few layers of a CNN Architecture.
- Dropout:
	Usually, when all the features are connected to the FC layer, it can cause overfitting in the training dataset. Overfitting occurs when a particular model works so well on the training data causing a negative impact in the model’s performance when used on a new data.

# What's next ?
The future of brain tumor detection is bright and focusing on improvements in several key areas:
- Advanced Machine Learning and AI: Deep learning algorithms are already showing promise in analyzing MRI scans for tumor detection with higher accuracy and earlier stage identification compared to traditional methods. This trend is expected to continue, with researchers creating more sophisticated models to differentiate tumor types and predict their behavior.
- Non-invasive techniques: Current detection methods like biopsies are invasive and can be risky. The future looks towards more widely available non-invasive techniques, potentially using blood tests or advanced MRI analysis to detect tumors.
- Multimodal Imaging: Combining data from different imaging modalities like MRI, PET scans, and CT scans is being explored to create a more comprehensive picture of the tumor. This can lead to more precise diagnoses and personalized treatment plans.
- Liquid Biopsy: Detecting tumor signatures in blood through liquid biopsies is a promising new approach. This could become a routine screening tool for early detection or to monitor treatment response.
- Focus on Personalized Medicine: By understanding the genetic makeup of individual tumors, treatments can be tailored to target specific mutations, leading to more effective therapies with reduced side effects.
